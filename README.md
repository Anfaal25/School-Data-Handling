# School Data Handling

## Introduction
Welcome to my School Data Handling project! This terminal-based application is designed to process and visualize school enrollment data based on user input and provided CSV files. The program allows users to retrieve statistics and generate plots for different school enrollment trends.

## Features
- Utilizes classes and objects to represent school information.
- Processes CSV files to extract enrollment data for different school years.
- Calculates mean enrollment and total number of graduates for specific schools.
- Generates scatter plots and subplots to visualize enrollment trends.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
- git clone https://github.com/Anfaal25/School-Data-Handling.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:
- cd School-Data-Handling



3. Run the `school_data.py` script using Python:
- python school_data.py



4. Follow the prompts to input a school name or code and see the statistics and plots.

## Examples
1. Input:
- Please enter the high school name or code: Centennial High School



Output:
- Requested School Statistics

- School Name: Centennial High School, School Code: 1224
- Mean enrollment for Grade 10: 200
- Mean enrollment for Grade 11: 180
- Mean enrollment for Grade 12: 150
- Total number of students who graduated in the past three years: 900


2. Input:
- Please enter the high school name or code: 1679


Output:
- Requested School Statistics

- School Name: Robert Thirsk School, School Code: 1679
- Mean enrollment for Grade 10: 250
- Mean enrollment for Grade 11: 240
- Mean enrollment for Grade 12: 200
- Total number of students who graduated in the past three years: 1200


## Conclusion
The School Data Handling project demonstrates my Python programming skills in data processing, visualization, and object-oriented programming. By utilizing classes and manipulating CSV data, I've created an application that helps users analyze school enrollment trends over multiple years.
